# Chat-Application-Web

(localhost)

This is a chat application named 'Unicat' created by using;
- HTML
- PHP
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Jquery
- AJAX
- Bootstrap
- MySQL

My intention was creating a fully functional chat application to provide communication among friends.
This application has not been completed at the moment but most of the functional parts are working as intended.

Here is a list of what the application offers to users:
- Creating an account and log in to your account.
- Adding a friend using their e-mail information.
- Accepting and declining friend requests.
- Seeing the friend list.
- Editing and showing 'What do you think' section.
- Online status (Online, Offline, Away) of yourself and friends.
- Start a conversation by clicking to the person you want to talk.
- Sending instant messages to your friends.
- Receiving instant messages from your friend. 
- Showing the message delivery time.

Will be added in the future:
- Latest message will be at the top position of 'Messages'
- Message notifications.
- File transfer / Upload a file
- Webcam Chat
- Themes
- Emojies
- Sounds
- Changing profile picture.
